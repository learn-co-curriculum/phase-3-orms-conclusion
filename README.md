# Object-Relational Mapping Conclusion

Now that we've discussed Object-Relational Mappers in depth, it should feel a
little less intimidating. We've established that they can make it easier to
write code, without using the SQL that you've already learned and practiced
several times. With Object-Relational Mapping, we are able to write those and
more complicated SQL queries we're familiar with, with less code using Ruby.

We've learned the many benefits of ORMs such as:

- Create tables in a corresponding Ruby class
- Insert data into the database from a Ruby method
- Find and update existing database records when changes are made its related
  Ruby object

We can map a database table to a Ruby object as well as can make Ruby objects
from database rows. With our ORM in place, other developers can leverage the
power of SQL in our Ruby class needing to write it themselves (or be fluent in
it)! Being able to leverage this functionality is awesome!
