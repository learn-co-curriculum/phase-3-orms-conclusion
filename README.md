# ORMs in Conclusion

Now that we've discussed Object-Relational-Mappers in depth, it should feel a
little less intimidating. We've established that they can make it easier to
write code, without using the SQL that you've already learned and practiced
several times. With Object-relational-mapping, we are able to write those and
more complicated SQL queries we're familiar with, with less code using Ruby.

We've learned the many benefits of ORMs such as: Abstracting database logic,
code that can insert into data into the database, find and update existing
database records when changes are made its related Ruby object, identify whether
or not a Ruby object has already been persisted to the database (and add it if
not). We can map a database table to a Ruby object as well as can make Ruby
objects from database rows, and can scrape and save data to the database. Now we
can leverage the power of SQL without needing to write it often (or be fluent in
it)! Being able to leverage this functionality is awesome!
